# InReach Ventures' Technical Interview

Thanks for taking the time to interview with us. 
We're very excited that you're interested in joining us and we hope you find this test challenging in a good way!
Time management and communication are as important as writing code, 
so we expect you to give us a good idea of how long you took to complete this, 
and to ask questions and communicate with us while you work on it.

How long you take is up to you, but our guideline would be 2 hours.

## The Challenge

The objective of this test to see how approach a data-science problem and your analytical process.
We have based this on Crunchbase's famous 2013 dump of their then database.

This dump comes in the shape of CSV files found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Vwc24zkGMwvmFKRgw_tcEHDacoQ98AC/view?usp=sharing.

The challenge here is to predict if a company will raise a Series A (funding round type), with a stretch goal to predict how much.

## Deliverable

Please provide us with the following:
* the .ipynb file
* instructions for running the notebook
* your results
* an explanation of what you did and why you did it

All of this can be provided in the notebook if you wish.

It's very important that we are able to run the notebook ourselves, so make sure that it expects the extracted data to be in `./data`.

The goal of this exercise is not to create the best or the purest model, but rather to describe the steps youâ€™ll take to accomplish it:
- Provide clear and understandable insights: for example, which variables seem to be the most correlated with raising a Series A?
- Explain the places that may have been the most challenging for you.
- Explain what next steps you would take

Good luck! Please remember to communicate with us while you're working on the project. 
We'll endeavour to be responsive, but remember that working remotely is all about time-management and asynchronous communication.
